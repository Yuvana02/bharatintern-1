Netflix Homepage Clone
Welcome to the Netflix Homepage Clone project repository! This project is a recreation of the Netflix homepage, showcasing my front-end development skills. Here's a brief overview:

Features
Responsive Design: The Netflix homepage clone is designed to be responsive and provide an optimal viewing experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Movie Carousel: Explore a dynamic movie carousel that displays a selection of popular movies. Users can navigate through the carousel to discover different titles.

Navigation Bar: The project includes a navigation bar that mimics the Netflix user interface, allowing users to easily browse through different genres and access the search functionality.

Movie Modal: Clicking on a movie poster opens a modal with additional details about the selected movie. This modal provides information such as the movie title, synopsis, and cast.

Footer: A footer section with links to relevant pages and social media icons to stay connected.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Markup language for structuring the content of the webpage.

CSS3: Stylesheets to enhance the visual presentation and layout.

JavaScript: Implemented for interactivity, dynamic content loading, and modal functionality.

TMDB API: Utilized The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch real-time movie data for the homepage.
